The "Greeting Cards Application" is a React-based project, built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS, to dynamically create and display greeting cards. 
The objective was to have ample practice in building reusable components, passing data through props, and styling effectively using a utility-first CSS framework. 
This project taught me how to set up a modern React application with Vite, create functional and modular components, and enhance them with responsive and interactive styles using Tailwind. 
It also gave me very valuable experience in debugging, organizing an application that is scalable, and guaranteeing the consistency of the user experience across devices. 
It really helped me understand React and CSS frameworks and how to tie together theoretical principles to concrete implementation.
